# Story Credits Concept for Storify #

The idea behind this concept is to promote the people behind each
story, beyond the editor who compiles the disparate pieces into 
a linear narrative.

The bullpen, the little widget at the bottom which begins the interaction 
with the credits screen, fills up with boxes representing the individual
sources that were brought together to construct the story.  By building
linearly, you get an instant impression of how many sources were used
and, after the initial build of unique credits there is a secondary 
build illustrating how many pieces each of these sources contributed 
to the story as a whole.


# Interacting with the Credits #

This is a bit of a toy and I just wanted to flesh the concept out enough
to show what the impact of a credits screen could be, especially for 
larger stories with lots of sources or even for smaller stories to which
several key sources play an outsized role.

For now, you can use the array keys (left and right) and cycle through
the credits.  It's a carousel, so feel free to run off the end of the
list.
